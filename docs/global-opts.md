# Global options

There are some options that can be added to any openupm command to change the apps behavior.

### Logging level

If you want extra information, for example for debugging purposes, you can run with the `--verbose` option. This will print a lot of extra logs.

### Color mode

By default openupm will print colors for some commands. If you don't want that then you can disable colors using the `--no-color` option.
